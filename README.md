# Simple Ruby Class with Getter and Setter

This example demonstrates a basic Ruby class with getter and setter methods. It's designed to illustrate common Ruby coding practices and is not intended to showcase an error or bug.

The `MyClass` class has an instance variable `@value`.  The `value` method acts as the getter, and the `value=` method acts as the setter.
